### Francis wyffels

Francis wyffels (Ghent University - IDLab-AIRO) is an early career professor with expertise in the domain of machine learning and robotics. Additionally, he has expertise in designing smart products and works on unconventional computing. Apart from his research, he strongly believes in dissemination activities. By means of international projects with children, students, and schools, he wants to ensure a more realistic perspective on what robotics can achieve, and reduce the almost innate fear for robotics.
